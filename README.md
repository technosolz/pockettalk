Read text messages in your pocket

You're driving down the highway when a text message comes in. Your phone's in 
your pocket, so what do you do? Risk your life as well as the lives of the
others around you as you fish around in your pocket, or read the message with
your thigh as your phone vibrates the contents of the message in International
Morse Code?
  
The answer is plain and simple, my friend. But if that sounds too daunting, the 
option is there for text messages to be read aloud. It's considerably less cool, 
however.

Be forewarned, however, that you are responsible for how you use this
application. You can download the app from Google Play here:
